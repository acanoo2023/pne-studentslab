For the first exercise if we place the debugger in the return line from the second function and we play de debug mode,
we can see that first it reads both functions and then it goes to the first print. The first print works correct but
in the next one (second print) we obtain a ZeroDivisionError and the program stops at that point. If we look at the
values of the variables, we can see that the values for the division t0 / t1 are "t0:2" and "t1:0"
